    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on
        the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it
        has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).

        HTML is a combination of <em>Hypertext and Markup language.</em> Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and
        Markup language defines the text document within the tag.</p>
